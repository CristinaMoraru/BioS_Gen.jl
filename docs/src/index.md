# BioS_Gen

I'm a bioinformatician and I'm developing bioinformatics workflows and algorithms in Julia. During this work, I created several datatypes and functions that I'm re-using in various workflows. In time, I have organized this code into a group of Julia packages, collectively named BioinfSuite. The following packages make part from BioinfSuite: BioS_Gen, BioS_ProjWFs, BioS_ExtTools and BioS_SeqFuns. 

The package documented here is [BioS_Gen](https://github.com/CristinaMoraru/BioS_Gen.jl), representing a small and various collection of usseful functions and datatypes.

The datatypes section documents a collection o datatypes for different file types used in bioinformatics.
